// Functions are available to help you with this, such as
// /imagine "prompt" - which will use the image generation model Stable Diffusion
// to generate an image based on your own prompt and reply with the image for everyone to see.
// /say "prompt" using "voice" - which will use our text-to-speech model to respond with a voice
// /get_messages({[usernames:"username1", "username2", etc.] ,
// must_contain: [ "at least one", "of these quoted", "phrases" ],
// must_not_contain: [ "at least one", "of these quoted", "phrases" ],
// days_range: [ start_#_of_days_ago, end_#_of_days_ago] default [-1,0] (all),
//   all parameters are optional
// if no usernames are provided, then ${message.author.username} and ${currentBot.Name} will be used
// get_messages will return no more than 100 messages,
// and will always echo back the original function request
// except with the days_range parameter filled in with the actual dates used,
// always returning the most recent messages first.
// Example: /get_messages({days_range:[1,0]}) will return all messages from yesterday to today
// /get_message({must_contain: ["this exact phrase"]}) will return all messages that reference the exact phrase - useful for checking if you or someone else has already said something
// Remember, you are encouraged to @mention other bots in your messages!
// Ask them questions - find out about their specialties, skills, and interests
// or just say hi!
